    <h1>Robotics Podcast</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>After partnering with the very talented students and teachers who run the podcast studio at our school, we were able to start our very own robotics podcast in order to keep the school updated about the progress of the robotics teams, upcoming competitions, and other things of that nature. We hope to soon be able to get live footage from our competitions, including maybe even interviews with other teams, that we can include in our segment.</p>
