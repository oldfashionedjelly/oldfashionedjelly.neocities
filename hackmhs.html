    <h1>Plant Doctor</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>This project was made by a bunch of nerds and I at our school's hackathon, hackMHS. We used the machine learning model VGG16 and trained it on over 1,000 images of healthy and diseased plant leaves of many varieties in order to be able to identify diseases and plants and treat them in order to prevent crop loss. We got second place in the sustainability track for our project and we hope to expand it by making the front end more user friendly and by hopefully being able to take in video footage, as well as increasing the number of plants and diseases that the model is trained on.</p>
