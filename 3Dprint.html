    <h2>Why I think 3D printers are cool</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>So I recently got my AnyCubic Mega Pro 3D printer working after about 8 months (turns out it justed needed a new SD card), and this combined with robotics starting up has really inspired me to get into 3D printing. At the moment I'm just doing simple prints, but hope to start printing some robotics parts. I'm working with some other students tomorrow to fix some of the 3D printers in the mill, in exchange for getting a new Banbu Lab printer (it's like 1,000 dollars). I've learned a lot in a very short amount of time so I'm very excited. For example, I just now today figured out how to change the fillament in the printer (whoops), so we're making progress.</p>
    <p>The reason why I thnk 3D printing is so cool is because it allows you to manufacture things with such crazy precision. Not only that but they are becoming simpler to use and more affordable to purchase for schools and 3D printing and making enthusiasts. I remember always using a 3D pen when I was younger, which is the same concept, but of course my scrubby 10 year old hands couldn't get nearly the same amount of detail.</p>
