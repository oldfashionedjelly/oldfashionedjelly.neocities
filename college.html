    <h2>My existential crisis about college applications</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>So I'm a sophomore. That leaves about a year until I have to start working on college applications and the SAT and all of that fun stuff. But so much emphasis is placed on how colleges percieve you, how others percieve you. I have wayyy too many interests, which means that I'm not able to persue all of them as much as I would like. So now how does this look to colleges? Like someone trying desperately to stand out by joining 20 extracurriculars but not really focusing on any of them. Which has meant that this year I've had to make so many desicions about what interests I want to persue, keeping college in mind. In fact that's one of the reasons that I made this website, so that I showcase the parts of me that I want to be showcased.</p>
    <p>Being in high school in general has meant that people start to group by interest. The nerds, the art kids, the band kids. It feels like everybody else knows exactly who they want to be. Joining robotics has really allowed me to persue my passion for engineering and science, and it's really helped me put into perspective how grades don't completely determine your future. Now that I've realized that I want to be an engineer, chances are my B in English isn't going to be the thing that comes in the way of me getting a degree. The only thing it comes in the way of is me enjoying my high school experience. If I could spend four hours a day working on robotics, I would, but I have so much homework to do with just being a student. Which has led me to one final conclusion, homework is an excellent tool to practice material from class, but when it interferes with the ability of students to persue their interests, that is where I draw the line.</p>
