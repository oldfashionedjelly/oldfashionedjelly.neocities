    <h1>Science Olympiad</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>Hi there! I've been doing Science Olympiad since seventh grade (I'm in tenth now) and have competed in events such as 
    <li>Astronomy</li> <li>Solar System</li> <li>Bridge</li> <li>Experimental Design</li> <li>Dynamic Planet</li> <li>Detector Building</li><li>Robot Tour</li><li>Tower</li>
    <p> I've done both virtual and in person competions, making it to states every year and even placing second in a few of my events. Here is where I will be open sourcing all of my study guides and resources for future scientists, so enjoy!</p>
    <p>Here's the link to the <a href=https://scioly.org/>Science Olympiad wiki</a> and here's the link to the official <a href=https://www.soinc.org/>Science Olympiad website</a>. Rules for 2024 season come out on September 5th!</p>
    <h2>Astronomy</h2>
      <p>Here is my very VERY entensive study guide for astronomy (we got second place, not to brag or anything), so do with it what you will. Is a lot of the information irrelevant, maybe, but I don't care. And make sure you become comfortable with the math portion of the competition. Oh and also have images of all the required objects, preferably multiple of them, and just maybe you'll luck out and have the exact image shown.</p>

    <h2>Solar System</h2>
      <p>Welcome to my horribly done solar system study guide, don't judge me I was in eighth grade and did this in a week, but we still got fourth so suck it.</p>
    <h2>Bridge</h2>
      <p>Before I share some of my designs for bridge as well as the winning structures, here is some advice. </p><li>First, allow yourself a lot of time to test multiple designs</li> <li>Second, make sure you read the parameters VERY carefully so you don't get disqualified (like three other teams in our division) </li><li>Third, test different kinds of wood, such as balsa and bass</li> <li>Fourth, make sure you do a basic stress test on your final bridge so it doesn't collapse right away (whoops)</li>
    <h2>Experimental Design</h2>
      <p>Number 1 piece of advice, uh don't forget to bring things. So to help I'm compiling a list of things to bring:</p>
      <li>Pencil</li>
      <li>Calculator</li>
      <li>Goggles</li>
      <li>Ruler</li>
      <li>Timer</li>
      <p>I would HIGHLY recommend looking over the <a href=https://scioly.org/wiki/index.php/Experimental_Design>scioly wiki</a> to read over what is required for each part. And remember to label your graphs.</p>
    <h2>Dynamic Planet</h2>
      <p>If you got stuck doing this event, I am very, very sorry for your loss. Anyways if it's any compensation here is my study guide.</p>
    <h2>Detector Building</h2>
      <p>Sooo I don't really have much advice I can offer you on this one, just make sure you prepare for both the build portion and the written portion.</p>
    <h2>Robot Tour</h2>
    <p>Mech drive goes hard</p>
    <h2>Tower</h2>
