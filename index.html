        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi there! My name is Alexandra, but I go by a lot of other things as well. I'm a student, an absolute nerd, a web developer, a musician, an artist, and many other things.<br> I do a lot of dumb stuff and have many interests so I've decided to throw them onto a website. Enjoy! I love music, art, anything robotics or computer science related, watching football and F1, and just being outside!</p>
